## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values handling, duplicates removal, categorical encoding  
- **Visualization (Python)**: EV distribution, top manufacturers, range vs. price  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards with filters (Year, Make, EV Type, State)  
- **Dataset**: Washington State EV Population Data (257K+ rows, 17 columns)

## ❓ Problem Statement  
As EV adoption accelerates worldwide, stakeholders need to answer:  
- Which **brands and models** dominate the EV market?  
- How has **EV adoption grown year-over-year**?  
- What is the distribution of **EVs by type (BEV vs. PHEV)**?  
- Which **regions/cities** lead in adoption?  
- How do **price and range trade-offs** impact consumer choices?  

This project delivers insights through **EDA + dashboard visualization**.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights  
- Cleaned and standardized **257K+ EV records** across 17 attributes.  
- Identified **Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan, Ford, Kia** as market leaders.  
- Segmented **EV types** → BEVs (~80%) vs. PHEVs (~20%).  
- Mapped **EV adoption by county and city** (Seattle, Bellevue, Vancouver leading).  
- Explored **price vs. range patterns** for consumer decision insights.
